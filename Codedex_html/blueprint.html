<!-- Let's practice HTML structure by creating a file called blueprint.html.

Make sure to add the following:

A <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
A <html> element with:
A <head> element with a page title.
A <body> element with a paragraph.
You now have the blueprint that you can use for all future HTML files! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Day la title</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>Toi dang hoc HTML tren codedex</p>
    </body>
</html>
